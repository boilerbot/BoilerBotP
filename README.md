Planning ahead for a semester and staying ahead of the game is extremely important for Purdue students. We intend to build BoilerBot, a Facebook Messenger chat bot that answers course related questions and efficiently provides all things Purdue at users fingertips. BoilerBot uniquely provides an aggregation of Purdue services by giving users quick access to useful information in one window. Thus, the bot will serve as an everyday companion to enhance the student experience at Purdue.
